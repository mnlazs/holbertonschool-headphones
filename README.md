## Implement a design:bulb:

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) will be your friend!

During these projects, you won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

It’s not an easy exercise, but it will be your life in company/start-up, you will discuss with designers, implement their work and make them review your implementation.

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling
use variables
simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Now, your turn!

### Important notes with Figma:

- if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)
- some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: #FF6565
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
---

## Requirements
- you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use Javascript
